Vision is the most dominant sense and is vital in our lives. 
According to World Health Organization (WHO), in 2021, about 295 million people globally have some type of vision impairment. 
Out of these 43 million are blind and 252 million have some sort of low vision. 
Furthermore, 90% of these people live in low-income countries, showing that most cannot afford expensive treatment options. 
Both blindness and vision impairment are two of the most incapacitating disabilities causing the individual to be affected personally, socially and economically. 

The purpose of this project is to design and develop a smart low-cost ultrasonic sensor glass system for the visually impaired. 
Using an LED and a buzzer, this glass system can detect objects and movement in front of the visually impaired person at two different lengths. 
As soon as the obstacle has been detected, the ultrasonic sensor sends a signal to activate the LED and buzzer alerting the person to stop before colliding with the object. 

The ultrasonic sensor smart glass system is made from an Arduino Uno microcontroller, an HC-SRO4 ultrasonic sensor, an active buzzer, and a LED.
It is powered by a 9 Volt Battery with an approximate total cost of $20. 
It is able to aid the visually impaired by detecting a nearby object at two different distances and alerting the user through the LED and the active buzzer.
